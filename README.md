This repository is where I document my path from understanding the basics of Python and Math to building Generative AI models. It's a mix of course notes, code snippets, and hands-on projects. 

The goal isn't just to copy-paste tutorials, but to break things, fix them, and understand the *why* behind the *how*.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap

I'm following a structured path to ensure I have a solid foundation before diving into complex topics.

### 🟢 Phase 1: Foundations
*Building the blocks.*
- [ ] **Python & Data Structures**: Advanced functions, OOP, and efficiency.
- [ ] **Mathematics for ML**: Linear Algebra (vectors, matrices), Calculus (gradients), and Stats/Probability.
- [ ] **Data Science Stack**: `numpy` for math, `pandas` for data wrangling, and `matplotlib`/`seaborn` for seeing the data.

### 🟡 Phase 2: Classical Machine Learning
*Understanding the logic before the magic.*
- [ ] **Supervised Learning**: Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVMs.
- [ ] **Unsupervised Learning**: K-Means, PCA, Clustering.
- [ ] **Model Evaluation**: Bias/Variance trade-off, precision/recall, ROC curves.

### 🔵 Phase 3: Deep Learning
*The neural networks era.*
- [ ] **Neural Net Basics**: Perceptrons, Backpropagation, Activation Functions.
- [ ] **Computer Vision (CNNs)**: Image classification, Object detection (YOLO), Segmentation.
- [ ] **NLP (RNNs/LSTMs)**: Text processing, Sequence models.
- [ ] **Modern NLP**: Transformers, BERT, GPT architecture.

### 🟣 Phase 4: MLOps & Deployment
*Getting models out of the notebook.*
- [ ] Dockerizing a model.
- [ ] Fast API serving.
- [ ] Model tracking (MLflow/Weights & Biases).

## 📚 Resources I'm Using

These are the resources guiding this repo:
1.  **Courses**: Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization, fast.ai.
2.  **Books**: *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*.
3.  **Papers**: Reading implementation papers (e.g., Attention Is All You Need).

## 🤝 Contribution

This is primarily a personal learning tracker, but if you spot a bug in my code or a flaw in my logic, please open an issue! Corrections are the best way to learn.
